# Introduction
When emulations of the General Assemblies of United Nations has come into fashion, demand on technical aspect is getting higher.
Though there's many products supporting this, there's few products that are open-source, free software
(instead of being only a [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware)).
Our goal is to create such a software, making it open, totally free (under a common open-source license), for everyone to use it.

# Development
It's currently under development. Everyone who wants to contribute to this project is welcome.

Due to limit of time, the development would be rather slow. We would be glad if you can offer help.
